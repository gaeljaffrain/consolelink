"""
Minimal local web app showing live console state: the 24 physical faders'
current output, plus the console's per-mode intensity memory.

Run:
    consolelink [--debug] [--capture PATH] [--no-web] [--artnet [DEST]]
              [--listen localhost|network] [--port N] [--allow-write [PASSWORD]]
(or `python -m consolelink ...`; `pip install -e .` from the repo creates the command).
Then open http://localhost:8765 in a browser (--port N for another port). By default only this machine can reach the page
(--listen localhost); --listen network also serves it to other devices on the same network, at
http://<this Mac's LAN IP>:8765 (e.g. `ipconfig getifaddr en0` for the IP; macOS will prompt to
allow incoming connections for python3 the first time a LAN client connects).

--allow-write [PASSWORD] (off by default) lets the page control the console: press its buttons
(BlackOut, Solo, Ind 1/2, the fader-mode buttons, the MEMS-only Int Only / Go Mode), hold a Bump
button, drag the 24 faders, MASTER, BUMPS, LIVE and NEXT, and pick the MEMS page. The page sends
POST /api/button|bump|fader|mems_page/... (see Handler.do_POST); with a
PASSWORD each request must carry ?pw=PASSWORD (the page asks for it in its settings; POST
/api/auth only checks it). The password travels in the URL over plain HTTP, so it keeps casual
users out and nothing more. It is required with --listen network, optional with --listen
localhost: without one, writes are accepted only from a page on localhost (Host and Origin
headers are checked, so another website open in the browser cannot press buttons). Writes go to the
USB thread, the only one that touches the device, through a queue -- or, for faders, a dict that
keeps only the latest value per fader.

Terminal only, no web server: add --no-web (with --debug, --capture and/or --artnet -- there is
nothing else for it to do). --debug prints every control change to stderr, plus a line for any
message type that has no decoder yet ("known, undecoded" or "UNEXPECTED", with the first bytes),
for finding not-yet-decoded controls.

--capture PATH appends every message (known or not) to PATH as a timestamped line with the full,
untruncated hex, for reading back like a packet capture: run with --capture capture.log, press
whatever is being investigated, Ctrl+C, then read the file. It is also the format the tests'
fixtures are cut from.

Stdlib only (plus pyusb, already required by protocol.py). No build step, no
npm, no framework -- a background thread polls the console over USB and a
plain http.server serves a static page over Server-Sent Events (GET
/api/events, text/event-stream) so every update is pushed the moment it's
decoded, rather than the page polling and silently skipping whatever changed
between polls.

Reuses the USB protocol implementation from protocol.py rather than re-deriving it -- see that
module's docstring for the wire-protocol details (idle poll, announce/ack handshake,
request_type(), type=0x0e/0x17 decoding).

Shows: the per-slot Intensity values (INT A, INT B, INT DEV) for all 24
fader slots -- these are the console's stored intensity levels, not raw
physical fader positions. Only whichever mode is currently active on the
console's fader-mode selector reflects live physical fader movement
(type=0x0e); the other two rows come from the console's separately
maintained intensity memory (type=0x0f) and only change when a fader is
moved while that mode is active. Plus Master (a real physical fader) and
Bumps. Independent 1/2, per the manual, are toggle/bump buttons (not
faders) -- shown as lights, decoded from type=0x0c. Also a dedicated
Physical Faders row: 24 bar+light indicators, one per physical fader,
mode-agnostic (type=0x0e for the live value, type=0x16 for the Bump LED --
solid/color-proportional once caught, blinking while the physical fader
hasn't yet caught its stored logical value after a mode switch). type=0x16 also carries the Solo,
BlackOut and MEMS-only Int Only / Go Mode LEDs; every LED's on/off/blinking is read from its real
colors (protocol.light_state) and sent to the page. And the console's two
LCDs, mirrored as text (type=0x15), and the Crossfader Live/Next levels (type=0x11). And the
console's DMX output, both universes (type=0x0d), for the "DMX Outputs" tab.

The fader and intensity values are output levels, level x Crossfader Live x Master (both
type=0x0e and the stored type=0x0f bank): a fader at full with Live and Master at 60% reads
36%, not 100%.

"""
Shared low-level protocol library for talking to the console over USB, reverse-engineered from
captured SmartSoft <-> console traffic. Used by app.py (the web app and terminal logger),
which doesn't re-derive any of this, it just imports it.

Opens the console over USB, claims the bulk vendor interface (interface 1), and speaks the
wire protocol reverse-engineered from captured SmartSoft <-> console traffic:

  - Idle poll: a 12-byte header, 6x uint16 LE (msgType, payloadLen, state[4]),
    sent OUT with msgType=0, payloadLen=0, state=[0,0,0,0]. NOT msgType=2 --
    a client that only sends msgType=2 gets zero replies.
  - The console replies with a 12-byte header too. If payloadLen>0, a second
    read on the same endpoint fetches exactly that many payload bytes.
  - When a control's value changes, the console first sends an "announce"
    (payload type=0x28) listing which object type(s) are ready (e.g.
    type=0x0e for faders/Bumps/Master, type=0x11 for the crossfaders). The
    host must ACK by sending one OUT header with msgType=2 and
    state[0]=<the announced type value>, followed by a plain msgType=0 poll
    -- only then does the console reply with the real data (payload type
    matching what was announced, wrapped in an IN header with msgType=3).
    This ack step is NOT optional -- skipping it means the announce repeats
    forever and the real value is never delivered.
  - `ConsoleLink.request_type()` gets the same data on demand instead of
    waiting for an announce -- works for every type both apps request at
    connect (0x0e/0x17/0x0f/0x0c/0x16).

Decodes:
  - type=0x0e (99 bytes): Fader 1-24, Bumps, Master (confirmed against real
    hardware across three separate captures). Mode-agnostic -- reports
    whatever's on a fader regardless of which fader mode is active: a
    fader's raw value means different things (an INT A level, an INT B
    level, a device intensity, ...) depending on type=0x17 below. The
    fader values are output levels, not lever positions: level x Crossfader
    Live (type=0x11) x Master, e.g. faders at full with Live and Master
    both at 60% read 36% (92) -- matching the devices' actual output.
  - type=0x0f (75 bytes): the stored intensity table -- unlike 0x0e (which
    only ever reports whichever fader mode is physically active), this holds
    all three intensity sub-mode banks (INT A/INT B/INT DEV) at once --
    `[header:1][INT A: 24][INT B: 24][INT DEV: 24]`.
  - type=0x0d (1026 bytes): the console's DMX output, both universes -- a 2-byte
    big-endian channel count (1024) then one level byte per channel. Pushed on
    every change to the output (never a timed stream); see decode_0x0d_dmx.
  - type=0x11 (209 bytes): Crossfader Live, Crossfader Next -- the two scene
    levels, not lever positions: once a crossfade completes the console
    resets them to Live=255, Next=0 wherever the levers physically are.
  - type=0x15 (81 bytes): the console's two physical LCDs, verbatim ASCII (plus
    8 bar-graph glyphs, see decode_0x15) -- 1 marker byte + 80 characters
    (2 displays x 2 lines x 20 chars). This is
    also currently the only way to see the 3 wheels' live values -- they
    don't touch type=0x0e/0x11 at all, only this LCD text and a
    correlated-but-undecoded type=0x16.
  - type=0x16 (637 bytes, mostly undecoded): bytes 517-528 are two adjacent
    6-byte Solo/BlackOut indicator blocks. Bytes `1+6*(N-1)` onward hold
    fader N's Bump LED as two RGB triples (the two blink phases) -- green in
    INT/PARAM modes, red in MEMS; see decode_0x16_bump_catch.
  - type=0x17 (7 bytes): the fader-mode selector, all six modes (INT A/INT
    B/INT DEV/PARAM 1/PARAM 2/MEMS) -- only fires unprompted on a mode
    CHANGE, but request_type() gets the true current mode on demand
    regardless.
  - type=0x18 (variable): the Device/Palette-Select row's resulting
    selection state as `[count][ids...]`, not a raw button code.
  - type=0x0c (85 bytes): Independent 1/2 name + on/off state.
  - Anything else: not decoded here (most buttons, wheels' raw deltas,
    curves, names/groups/cues).

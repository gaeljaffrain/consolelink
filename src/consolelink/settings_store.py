"""Persistent settings for the menu-bar app (the command line has its own flags).

Everything but the control password goes into a JSON file in the user's application-support
folder. The password goes into the macOS Keychain instead (via the `keyring` package, loaded only
when needed), so it never sits in a file or on a command line. Pure Python apart from that, so the
rules can be tested on any OS with a fake password store.
